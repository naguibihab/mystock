# Platform
###  Decision 1
The first decision I have to make is to decide what platform to use that can put something together quickly and without wasting anytime in setting it up, I rounded them down to two options:
- Angular + Firebase
- Angular + Nodejs + DynamoDb

I choose Firebase due to its ease and the ability to host on it.

### Decision 2
My Second decision was to use Angular seed or simply go with a Pure Angular application, Angular Seed seems like an overkill given that I don't need any routing but I decided to go with it anyway as it will be the quicker option and having the option to do easy routing later on might come in handy for a future version of this project.
